JS Head Tag to integrate Moveo One analytics

To install the Moveo One analytics library for web, please follow the instructions below:

1. Include the two <script> lines at the very end of every page you want to track—just before each </body> tag. For example, on every HTML file:

```html
<!-- At the very end of the <body>, just before </body> -->
<script src="https://moveoonestorage.blob.core.windows.net/000-scripts/moveo-one-script.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize MoveoOne with their token
  const moveo = MoveoOne.init('YOUR_TOKEN_HERE');
</script>
```
